# The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Imagine if you brought up your website today and said, _"I need to make sure people with disabilities can use this"_. Or _"How do I know if my website is accessible?"_ One way to know is to evaluate your website against a set of standards or measurable criteria. And the standards for measuring accessibility on the Web are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (or WCAG).

## What is WCAG?

WCAG is an abbreviation for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. It is often pronounced “wuh-cag”, or “double-u cag”.

WCAG is a standard developed by the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Just like the W3C helps develop standards for HTML and CSS, they also develop specifications for accessibility standards.

WCAG is the standard that defines how to make Web content _more accessible_ to people with disabilities. It defines a baseline set of guidelines that digital content must meet in order to provide **minimum levels of accessibility**. If web content doesn’t meet these levels, it is not considered accessible.

WCAG enables all organizations to measure the accessibility of content, sites, and apps against documented **success criteria** (which we will talk about in a few minutes). Following WCAG means your business is complying with just about any federal, state, or local law about accessibility for people with disabilities. As such, it is an important asset for businesses, organizations, and other entities who want to make their Web content accessible to more people.

WCAG includes **guidelines relevant to design, content and code**. So it benefits everyone on your production team to be familiar with them.

## WCAG Versions

Like any Web standard, WCAG has evolved over the last few decades to become more universal and inclusive. And much like other Web standards, several versions of WCAG have been published over the years. You will probably come across more than one version of WCAG referenced in different projects and even in laws, so it helps to understand the difference as well as the relationship between these versions.

### WCAG 1.0

The first ever version of WCAG was WCAG 1.0. [WCAG 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/) was published in May 1999 and was focused mainly on HTML. It was a great step into making Web content accessible. It contained 14 guidelines.

As technology advanced, WCAG did too. And almost a decade later, WCAG 2.0 was released.

### WCAG 2.0

[WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) was published in December 2008. In order to account and accommodate for a wider range of technologies, WCAG 2.0 introduced the four guiding principles of accessibility, stating content must be **Perceivable, Operable, Understandable**, and **Robust**, referred to as _POUR_. These principles are supported by **guidelines** that guide developers to make all digital content accessible as opposed to only addressing content implemented using HTML—that includes content in a PDF or a text document like Word or a Google Doc or a spreadsheet, or a presentation, or an eBook, or a native mobile app. The guidelines themselves are supported by **success criteria** for meeting those guidelines.

WCAG 2.0 reigned as the gold standard for a long time.

### WCAG 2.1

In June 2018, almost a decade later, [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) was published as an official recommendation. While WCAG 2.0 was almost a complete overhaul of WCAG 1.0, WCAG 2.1 builds on and extends WCAG 2.0. It uses the same terminology used in version 2.0. So **WCAG 2.1 is backwards-compatible, which means if you conform to WCAG 2.1, you automatically conform to WCAG 2.0** And if you are required by law to conform with WCAG 2.0, you will be able to update your content accessibility to WCAG 2.1 without losing conformance with WCAG 2.0.

Both WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 are [referenced in laws and regulations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) around the world today.

### WCAG 2.2

On October 5th, 2023, [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), an extension of the existing WCAG 2.1 standards, was published as an official recommendation.

The dot releases are very focused on filling known gaps that have developed over the years since the adoption of WCAG 2.0 as the standard for web accessibility, but a complete overhaul of these standards will ultimately be necessary.

### WCAG 3 (Silver)

In parallel with WCAG 2.2, a task force was formed to create an entirely new set of standards for Web accessibility, which will result in another major version of the accessibility guidelines that will change the terminology as well as the structure of WCAG as we know it. This new set of guidelines will be called **“W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0”** —code named **[“Silver”](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/work-statement)**.

The removal of "web" in the name is meant to reflect the intention that these criteria can ultimately be applied to more than just web content. They are meant to address more types of disabilities, and tackle the accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other Web of Things devices.

[WCAG 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/) is currently an incomplete working draft. It is intended to develop into a W3C Standard in a few years.

We will be using WCAG 2.1 as our main reference for accessibility requirements that we’ll be discussing in many chapters of this course, but we’ll also mention some of the new criteria introduced in 2.2 where they are relevant.

---

WCAG is a tool that is meant to help us create more accessible products. And it does so by introducing principles and guidelines that define what Web content needs to be to be considered accessible.

WCAG 2.1 has **13 guidelines** that are organized under **4 principles**. For each guideline, there are **testable success criteria**, which are at **three conformance levels**: A, AA, and AAA.

Let’s elaborate on what all of this means.

## The four principles underlying WCAG (P.O.U.R)

The Web content accessibility guidelines are set around 4 fundamental design principles:

- that Web content must be **Perceivable**,
- that UI controls must be **Operable**,
- that content and controls must be **Understandable**, and
- that content must be **Robust**.

These are often referred to by the acronym “P.O.U.R”.

- **Perceivable** means that users must be able to perceive Web content in some way, using one or more of their senses (it can’t be invisible to all of their senses)
- **Operable** means that users must be able to control UI elements (e.g. buttons must be activated in some way — mouse, keyboard, voice command, etc.). The user interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform.
- **Understandable** means that the content must be understandable to its users.
- **Robust** means that the content must be developed using well-adopted web standards that will work across different browsers, now and in the future.

By focusing on principles, not technology, the guidelines **emphasize the need to think about the various ways that people interact with content.**

We mentioned in the previous chapter that people may have various kinds of disabilities, and that they may access the Web using a variety of available assistive technologies. So the principles and guidelines outlined in WCAG **try to be** inclusive of as many people with disabilities as possible, regardless of ability or circumstance; this includes users with impairments to their: **vision, hearing, mobility, speaking, or cognition (thinking and understanding).**

These 4 principles apply to all aspects of your service—including design, code, content and interactions, which means all members of your team should be familiar with them to create better products. And the guidelines apply to mobile content, too.

---

To _guide_ you towards applying these principles in your work, each principle is supported by a set of guidelines.

## The guidelines

Under each principle there is a list of guidelines that address the principle.

WCAG 2.1 principles are supported by 13 guidelines, organized and categorized under the 4 principles.

Each guideline has **a number and a statement that describes what the guideline requires.**

There are 4 guidelines under the first principle: “Perceivable”.

- **1.1 – Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
- **1.2 – Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media.
- **1.3 – Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
- **1.4 – Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

There are 5 guidelines under the second principle: “Operable”.

- **2.1 – Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
- **2.2 – Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content.
- **2.3 – Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.
- **2.4 – Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
- **2.5 – Input Modalities**: Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.

There are 3 guidelines under the third principle: “Understandable”.

- **3.1 – Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable.
- **3.2 – Predictable**: Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
- **3.3 – Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

And there is one guideline under the fourth principle: “Robust”.

- **4.1 – Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

Reading the guidelines you’ll find that they are open to interpretation. This makes them hard to measure and test. How do you know what steps to take to meet the requirements of a guideline? How do you determine when a website fails or does not meet a guideline?

To make the guidelines **actionable, measurable** and **testable—which** is important to ensure they have been followed, WCAG breaks down each guideline into **specific, largely technical** requirements—or, “success criteria”—that your service needs to meet—or “conform” to—in order to be more accessible.

## The success criteria

The 13 guidelines are broken down into 78 success criteria (SCs).

> **WCAG is all about Success Criteria. The Principles and Guidelines are just "buckets" for the Success Criteria, to organize them logically.— David MacDonald President, CanAdapt, and WCAG Working Group Invited Expert**

The **success criteria** are the smallest division of the WCAG standards.

A success criterion (SC) is a **testable, technical statement that targets one or more specific accessibility issue(s)**. They’re kind of like antibodies in that sense.

For example:

**SC 1.4.1 Use of Color** states that Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

**SC 1.4.4 Resize Text** states that Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.

The success criteria are testable because they are very specific and technical. So we should be able to determine whether the content passes a criterion or not with a relatively high degree of confidence.

Let’s look at another SC for an example.

**SC 3.1.1 Language of page** states that the default human language of each web page can be programmatically determined.

This statement can be tested by checking whether the document has a valid lang attribute set. The lang attribute defines the natural language of the page. It affects how screen readers will read and announce content on the page, and can make or break an experience for users. The lang attribute is also used by browsers to handle things like hyphenation, punctuation, and number formatting, for example. So it is important set the lang attribute on the root (html) element to define the natural language of the page. English content uses en, which is the language code for English. French content uses the fr language code. German content requires the de language code. And so on and so forth.

**There are 78 success criteria in WCAG 2.1. Each criterion targets one or more accessibility issues.**

All the criteria are written as testable statements for determining if content satisfies them. If content satisfies the criteria, then this content is said to ‘conform’ to WCAG.

## What does conforming to WCAG mean?

Conformance to a standard means that you satisfy the ’requirements’ of that standard. In WCAG 2.x (WCAG 2 and all its dot versions), the ‘requirements’ are the success criteria.

So, to conform to WCAG, you need to satisfy the success criteria. That is, you have no **content which violates the success criteria.**

Which success criteria apply to the content depends on the content itself. **Not all success criteria apply all of the time.**

The success criteria target **specific issues to various types of content** (audio, video, forms, text, etc.). So if your website does not contain any multimedia content then none of the SCs under **Guideline 1.2 Time-based Media** will apply. You should a**im to satisfy the success criteria that are applicable to your content**.

This also means that **if there is no content to which a SC applies, this SC is satisfied**.

Accessibility audits of websites are conducted using a subset or all of the 78 SCs. Each aspect of a site can be reviewed and determined if it passes or fails each of the criteria being tested. The result of the audit helps determine if the website as a whole conforms to WCAG.

Conformance in WCAG differs from conformance to other standards. Most standards have one level of conformance. But WCAG has three conformance levels. You may aim to meet one or more of these levels.

## The three levels of conformance: A, AA, AAA

As you know by now, people are diverse, and they are diverse in their abilities, their disabilities, as well as the ways that they use to access the Web. Content that is accessible to a group of people with disabilities, may not be accessible to another. How do you know just how much accessibility you’ve ensured?

In order to accommodate different types of disabilities and situations that may require different affordable or levels of accommodation, **the W3C have broken up the Success Criteria into three different implementation levels.** These levels are commonly referred to as conformance levels. The three levels are: **Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.**

Every success criterion is assigned one of these three conformance levels. **The conformance level indicates the level of accessibility that the success criterion ensures**, ranging from the bare minimum for accessibility (Level A) to going above and beyond (Level AAA).

![success criteria]("./markdown assets/03.1.Success-Criteria.webp")

The conformance levels are best demonstrated with an example.

You probably already know that text should have a certain amount of color contrast with its background to be readable and discernible by people with moderately low vision. The WCAG include criteria for color contrast levels that ensure the text is accessible to them.

In order to ensure **a minimum accessible contrast**, SC 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) states that the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. This success criterion is a Level AA criterion.

The Level AAA version of this criterion—SC 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)—states that The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1. The minimum required contrast for large text also increases in this level compared to the previous.

![color contrast demo]("./markdown assets/03.2.color contrast demo.webp")

The first paragraph of text has a color #6F6F6F. Against the white (#FFF) background, this paragraph has a contrast ratio of 5.02:1, which satisfies SC 1.4.1 Contrast (Minimum) Level AA.

The second paragraph has a color of #565656. Against the white background, this paragraph has a contrast ratio of 7.33:1, which satisfies SC 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) Level AAA.

A shade of gray that satisfies Level AA contrast requirements does not necessarily pass Level AAA contrast requirements. The higher the contrast, the more readable the text is.

For most user interface requirements, you’ll find that the higher the conformance level, the higher the accessibility requirements, and the more the design is affected.

WCAG 2.1 includes 78 success criteria, each assigned one of the three conformance levels. There are 30 success criteria rated at level A; 20 success criteria rated at level AA; and 28 success criteria rated at level AAA.

Achieving conformance to a WCAG level means satisfying the level’s success criteria — all of them.

### Level A

Level A is **critical to the accessibility of Web content**. Not meeting this level of accessibility means that people with disabilities may find it impossible to access the content.

To achieve Level A conformance, your content must satisfy **all the Level A Success Criteria**, or a conforming alternate version is provided.

The Level A criteria have the greatest impact and are the easiest to address. Some accessibility requirements under Level A include:

- providing alterative text for images
- making sure color is not the only means used to convey information (for example, including an icon within an error message for colorblind users)
- ensuring all functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard (because not all - people can use a mouse device to navigate the Web)
- ensuring links have clear labels that clearly indicate their purpose
- providing shortcuts on the page to allow users to bypass repeated sections of content across pages
- providing captions for pre-recorded audio content

Many aspects of the user experience are covered in Level A. But Level A provides minimal accessibility and does not meet the needs of all people with disabilities.

### Level AA

Level AA criteria target more barriers to access and provide accessibility requirements for most people with disabilities. It is an **essential level** of accessibility.

Level AA criteria target more barriers to access and provide accessibility requirements for most people with disabilities. It is an essential level of accessibility.

Level AA criteria include further accessibility improvements to Level A, including:

- ensuring a more readable contrast between text and background colors
- ensuring the content can be accessed on various devices
- ensuring that the page content is implemented in a way that does not prohibit page zoom
- providing clearly visible focus indicators so that keyboard users can identify their current whereabouts on a page
- properly conveying page structure using appropriate descriptive headings and labels

For Level AA conformance, your content must satisfy all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.

While satisfying Level AA covers a wide range of disabilities, significant barriers could remain for some people.

### Level AAA

The highest accessibility conformance level is Level AAA. Level AAA may not always be achievable. This is why even the W3C do not advocate for trying to meet AAA across the board. But if you can meet Level AAA, it will be a big win for the users of your site.

Some of the criteria that fall under Level AAA include:

- ensuring all functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes
- ensuring a higher color contrast than that required in Level AA
  allowing the user to disable animations triggered by interactions
- ensuring interactive elements have target sizes large enough for users to easily activate them
- ensuring users can understand abbreviations by giving them access to the expanded form of those abbreviations

For Level AAA conformance, your content must satisfy **all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria**, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.

Many of the Level AAA criteria are actually fairly simple and easy to implement. And depending on your content, if you meet AA you may already meet some of the AAA requirements. So I do recommend trying to satisfy as many success criteria as you can in order to ensure as high a level of accessibility as possible, by catering for as many accessibility barriers as you can.

Keep in mind that WCAG is a binary standard; meaning that there is no such thing as “partial WCAG support”. The success criteria are very specific, meaning that you either pass them or you don’t. [Partially supported is not supported](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/partially-supported-is-not-supported).

## Outro

Although the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are not enforceable requirements by themselves, there are many accessibility regulations worldwide that do require conformance with WCAG success criteria — WCAG 2.0 level A and level AA criteria being the most widely adopted requirements.

If you don’t have specific accessibility regulations that apply to your organization but want to avoid legal risk, **WCAG 2.1 level AA compliance** is a safe bet. Given that WCAG 2.1 contains everything in WCAG 2.0 plus extra guidance for users of mobile devices, touch, voice, as well as cognitive disabilities, a good default position is to implement WCAG 2.1 knowing that you have covered all the requirements for both desktop and mobile web accessibility.

Accessibility experts typically conduct audits of websites using a subset or all of the 78 success criteria. Each aspect of a site can be reviewed and determined if it passes or fails the success criteria. The result of the audit helps determine if the website conforms to WCAG guidelines and is therefore considered “accessible”.

WCAG is also what accessibility testing tools use to find and flag possible accessibility issues on your websites. (So you could think of it as a measuring stick for accessibility.)

But here’s the thing: Even though having a set of testable criteria is practical, helpful and convenient, satisfying the WCAG criteria does not guarantee that your website is usable. And in the next video, we’re going to discuss why.
