> The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

This quote by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web (www), is used quite often in the accessibility community. And I believe it is a very fitting quote to start this course with.

Accessibility is an **essential aspect** of the Web’s universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is what makes the Web _accessible_. If it’s not accessible, the Web isn’t _truly_ universal. The Web literally wouldn’t be what it was meant to be if it’s not accessible!

On the Web, accessibility has a very specific meaning. And in order to design and develop _accessible_ digital products, we need to clearly define **what makes a product accessible.**

In this chapter, we’re going to define what web accessibility exactly is. This definition will guide every design and development decision you will make as you endeavour to create more accessible websites and applications.

We’re also going to discuss the difference between accessibility, inclusively (or inclusive design), and usability **in the context of the web.**

Understanding the difference between accessibility, inclusively, and usability on the web is sometimes critical in guiding some of your design decisions, as well as determining which approach or strategy you may want to use in your development process.

Understanding how accessibility is different from usability will also help you understand what accessibility specialists usually mean when they say that accessibility compliance is not enough, and that you should aim for **usability** to ensure that your work is _truly_ accessible.

And finally, since there is no accessibility without disability, we’re going to talk about the different kinds of disabilities, and the different ways people with disabilities access the Web, including various types of assistive technologies.

So, let’s dive in!

## What is Web accessibility?

In its strictest definition, the word “accessibility” means “the quality of being able to be reached or entered”. It refers to the ability to access information or systems.

In the context of the Web, however, accessibility has a more specific meaning.

**Web accessibility** refers to making websites and applications **accessible to people with disabilities**. It is about **removing barriers to access**, so that websites and applications can be **accessed** and used by **people with disabilities.**
There are many types of barriers that people with disabilities may encounter.

In the physical world, a barrier to access might come in the form of things like:

- Stairs and curbs without ramps (which deny access to people using wheelchairs)
- Narrow sidewalks, doorways, or aisles
- Small toilets and washing facilities without grab bars
- Inaccessible furniture, such as high shelves and tables without leg space
- Low lighting (which makes it hard for people who are deaf to communicate visually)
- Weak color contrast
- Lack of automatic or push-button doors

On the Web, there are several things you might do that can potentially impede access to information for people with disabilities. Digital barriers to access can take many forms, including but not limited to:

- Absence of keyboard focus indicators
- Absence of labels on form controls
- Buttons, links and UI widgets that can’t be operated with a keyboard
- Images without alternative (alt) text
- Videos without captions, transcripts, or audio descriptions
- Low color contrast and small fonts
- And certain types of motion and animations that can’t be paused or stopped

Throughout the course, we’ll tackle various kinds of barriers and learn how to avoid them, as well as fix existing barriers in your projects.

## What is a11y?

Accessibility is often referred to as “a11y” in the web community. If you’re new to accessibility, you may have come across this term already and you may have wondered what it means.

![a11y (pronounced A-one-one-Y or A-eleven-Y) is a numeronym of the word “accessibility”. A numeronym is a word that uses numbers to shorten words.](./markdown%20assests//02.What-is-web-accessibility-numeronym.jpg)

_a11y_ (pronounced A-one-one-Y or A-eleven-Y) is **a numeronym of the word “accessibility”**. A numeronym is a word that uses numbers to shorten words.

The word accessibility is made of 13 letters. There’s 11 letters between the letter “a” and the letter “y”. So this term was created to shorten the word “accessibility” to “a11y”, with the 11 representing the 11 letters between “a” and “y”.

For many people new to the accessibility world, this term may be unfamiliar. So, like other acronyms or abbreviations, if you’re going to use this abbreviation, a good practice is to spell out the word “accessibility” in full the first time, and follow it with the numeronym that it represents:
**Accessibility (a11y)**

By doing so, you’re making it understandable, which is a requirement of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. (We’ll learn more about the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in the next chapter.)

The term “a11y” also has the added benefit of looking like the word “ally”, which may or may not have been intentional, but is a welcome similarity.

That being said, if the word “a11y” literally looks like the word “ally”—as in, the letter “l” and the number “1” are indistinguishable—it might be a sign that your chosen typeface may not be very readable for some people. If that’s the case, you may want to choose a different typeface that has easily distinguishable characters so that it is more decipherable by users with visual or cognitive disabilities, such as dyslexic users.

## What is the difference between accessibility, inclusively, and usability in the context of the web?

The terms “accessibility” and “inclusivity” (or inclusive web design) are often used interchangeably in the context of the web. But they do mean different things.

**Web accessibility design** is about ensuring **equal access** or people with disabilities. It is about **removing barriers to access** so that **people with disabilities** can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and applications. It addresses issues **specifically related to disability**, and it does not try to address broader issues.

On the other hand, **inclusive web design** is about encapsulating **a wide range of people** from various backgrounds and cultures, ages, abilities and disabilities, genders, geographical locations, languages, computer literacy, and more. It tries to address **diverse issues** so that all users are involved to the greatest extent possible—and that includes people with disabilities. So inclusive design encompasses accessibility. **A product isn’t inclusive if it is not accessible.**

Internationalization is an example of an Inclusive Design effort, targeting users speaking different languages—regardless of disability—but it is not specifically an accessibility effort.

Web performance is another example of inclusive design, targeting people on low-end devices or slower internet connections, who might be located anywhere around the world, and who may or may not be living with a disability or living in a situation that limits their ability to access information on the Web.

An inclusive designer is proactive in **pursuing inclusion of everyone** as much as possible, regardless of ability or disability. An accessibility designer, on the other hand, **focuses primarily on the needs of people with disabilities.**

A Web accessibility designer would design a website that a person with a disability can use, whether that person is accessing it using a screen reader, a keyboard, a braille display, switch controls, or any other form of **input modality** or assistive technology. For example, someone using a screen reader or those who navigate the Web using a keyboard should be able to carry out the same tasks on a website as someone without a disability.

### Accessibility design benefits everyone

Inclusive design includes people with disabilities. So **accessibility is a natural outcome of effective inclusive design.**

And accessible design can also benefit people without disabilities, making products inclusive of more people.

Let’s take an example from the physical world first: accessibility curb cuts.

![A deep ramp from the street to sidewalk level, wide and painted blue with a white wheelchair symbol; another ramp where pavemnts meet, this one with a yellow textured rectangle set into it.](./markdown%20assests/02.2.ramp.webp)

Curb cuts (or ramps) can make pedestrian crossings and walkways accessible to wheelchair users or other people who may struggle with high curbs.

Accessibility ramps also benefit people without disabilities, such as people pushing strollers, carts, or other wheeled objects. If you’ve ever dragged heavy luggage across streets on your way to a train station or the airport, for example, then you too are likely to have experienced the benefit of accessibility design.

Many **digital accessibility** features benefit people without disabilities, too. A good example of an accessibility feature used by people without disabilities is: **captions**.

Captions are an accessibility feature that is required to make video content accessible to people with hearing disabilities. But their benefits extend far and beyond.

Captions are useful to many people in varying situations and environments:

- they are needed by people who are deaf or hard of hearing
- they are used by non-native speakers to aid in comprehension
- they are preferred by many people who comprehend written words better than audio
- they are used by someone working in a quiet or a noisy place (such as a library, a coffee shop, in a nursery with a sleeping baby, or in a meeting!)
- they are used in public places such as airport or airport lounges where TVs and videos are muted by default, and rely on captions fully
- they have also been particularly useful in times of COVID as many conferences went online and talks were given by speakers with low-end microphones or spotty wifi, making non-trivial portions of their talks difficult to understand

And there are many more day-to-day contexts in which people will benefit from reading captions and subtitles.

Captions and transcripts are but one of many accessibility features that are beneficial to all people.

High contrast display modes are also an accessibility feature that makes digital content more usable for all people. Someone working on their phone or computer outside on a sunny day may increase the contrast of the display to increase its readability.

I could go on and on about examples of accessibility features that are used on a day-to-day basis not only by disabled people but by those who are not.

All this means that **accessibility requirements also benefit people and situations that are the target of inclusive design**. But keeping accessibility focused on disabilities encourages research and development on the specific needs of people with disabilities, and solutions that are optimized for these specific needs.

Most accessibility requirements also make Web content more _usable_ by more people.

### Accessibility vs Usability

There’s a lot of overlap between accessibility and usability, but they are not the same.

The International Standards Organization (ISO) defines usability as the “extent to which a product can be used by specified users **to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction** in a specified context of use”. (emphasis mine)

In other words, usability design should support diverse users in their diverse contexts to **accomplish their tasks with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.**

Usability practice and research may not specifically target the needs of people with disabilities, but it could address accessibility when:

- “specified users” includes people with a range of disabilities, and
- “specified context of use” includes accessibility considerations such as assistive technologies.

**So accessibility design targets the needs of people with disabilities. Inclusive design targets the needs of a diverse group of people, including people with disabilities. And usability design is the extent by which users are enabled to achieve their goals effectively, efficiently, and with satisfaction.**

By narrowing the definition of usability design to focus on _**users with disabilities**_ , we could say that usability design must ensure that products are usable by people with disabilities.

Accessibility, on the other hand, does not always ensure that a product is usable. Not all accessible websites are usable. You can have an accessible website that is completely unusable.

When we say that a website is accessible we usually mean that it complies to standard accessibility requirements and that the content can be programmatically accessed. But how effectively and efficiently that content can be accessed determines how usable it is.

Users need to be able to do things quickly and efficiently. And they need to feel satisfied with the results. You may have a technically-accessible site that is a nightmare to use.

**The only way to make sure something is usable is by observing people succeed in using it.**

To ensure a site is usable, you should conduct usability tests that may uncover difficulties or possible barriers your users are facing that are making their experience inefficient, and then address those issues in your design and implementation.

For example:

- do you have dozens of links and repeated content on pages and no quick way to skip over them?
- Is the way you’re loading your interface preventing the user from doing what they want as fast as they want to?
- Do all controls have clear and visible labels?
- How easy or difficult is it to perform certain tasks?
- Does everything work with keyboard as expected?
- Are users having any difficulty performing certain tasks

because you’re using unexpected key combinations and interactions?
Are your components easy to operate? or are they too complex?
Usability testing will help you find and uncover barriers to access that you may not have considered during your design and development process, so that you can come up with more inclusive solutions.

So accessibility implementation is the first step in making truly inclusive and usable products, and it should always be followed by usability testing.

> **“Think of accessibility as the lowest bar; it works with assistive technology, but to go beyond ‘it works’ to ‘it’s enjoyable and easy to use’ you’ll need to test with real users.” — Kate Kalcevich, Head of Services at Fable**

Ultimately, both inclusive and accessible products need to be usable. Because how inclusive and accessible are they really if they can’t be used by the people they were designed for?

Back to accessibility. :)

Accessibility is about removing barriers to equal access for people with disabilities.

There is no accessibility design or accessibility development without disabilities.

We can’t design and develop for accessibility without knowing more about what and who we are designing for. In the following sections, we’ll learn more about the different types of disabilities, and how people with disabilities access the Web.
