## Accessibility in WWW context

Web accessibility refers to making websites and applications accessible to **people** with **disabilities**

It is about **removing barriers to access,** so that websites and applications can be accessed and used by people with disabilities.

### Example of barriers to access in the physical world

- Stairs and curbs without ramps(which deny access to people using wheelchairs)
- Narrow sidewalks, doorways, or aisles
- Small toilets and washing facilities without grab bars
- Inaccessible furniture, such as high shelves and tables without leg space
- Lack of automatic or push-button doors
- Low lighting(which makes it hard for people who are deaf to communicate visually)
- Weak color contrast

### Example of digital barriers to access:

- Absence of keyboard focus indicators,
- Absence of labels on form controls,
- buttons, links, and other UI widgets that can't be operated with a keyboard,
- images without alternative text (alt-text)
- videos without captions, transcripts, or audio descriptions,
- low color contrast and small fonts,
- certain types of animations that can't be paused or stopped.
