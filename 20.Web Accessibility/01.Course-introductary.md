# Intro to the course

This course tackles topics in-depth, while remaining practical. Since many aspects of accessibility are interlinked, you will hear a lot of We will learn about this in more detail in another chapter in most chapters.

The content becomes more geared towards code as we advance in the course and start applying everything we’ve learned to create common UI patterns. It also becomes more advanced in the second half of the course, which builds upon much of the knowledge covered in the first half. So, once again, I highly recommend going through all of the chapters, and doing so in order.

Each chapter is available in video and in text format. The text of the chapter contains all the code snippets and live working examples that are discussed in each video.

## The accessibility toolkit

Throughout the course, we will mention standards and specifications, as well as tools and resources that are helpful for your accessibility work. To make referencing them in your day-to-day work easier, I collected the most practical ones in the Toolkit page. You can think of the toolkit as a (growing) collection of useful and practical bookmarks.

And at the end of each chapter, I’ve included helpful resources that I highly recommend you check out. Even if, at the end of a chapter, you feel like you’ve understood the ins and outs of a subject, reading more about it will help you further solidify your knowledge.
