# Does satisfying WCAG criteria guarantee that your website is usable?

It is a very common misconception that if you meet all of the WCAG success criteria then your content will work for everyone. But the truth is that that’s not always true. And it’s important to understand _why_ **WCAG conformance is not enough**, so that you can always look beyond legal requirements, to create products that do work for people.

WCAG conformance is often not enough. It does not guarantee that everyone with a disability will be able to use what you design and build. For many reasons…

## Conformance does not guarantee usability

For example, say your legal requirement is to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA, then you may pass the legal compliance levels by meeting all of the the WCAG 2.1 Level AA criteria; **but meeting these criteria does not mean that there are no more barriers to access your content.**

WCAG 2.1 Level AA includes 20 success criteria that address various accessibility barriers. Many other accessibility barriers are addressed in WCAG Level AAA criteria as well as in WCAG 2.2 criteria. Your content may include some or many of these barriers but still be considered “accessible” because it passes the Level AA conformance requirements.

Your content may contain a lot of abbreviations, for example, or may include language that is difficult to understand for many people. You may be technically conformant to WCAG Level AA requirements, but your content would still be unusable for many people.

## WCAG guidelines don’t address all accessibility issues

Even if your content meets all of the WCAG criteria — including WCAG 2.1 Level AAA criteria, your content or service may still be excluding some people with disabilities.

> **even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive language and learning areas.**

WCAG tackles specific issues as they come up, but the guidelines don’t tackle all possible accessibility barriers. So even if you technically satisfy all the criteria, your website, application, or service may have usability and accessibility issues that are simply not addressed in the guidelines.

## WCAG does not tackle usability issues

WCAG also does not **address usability issues**. Because of that, WCAG conformance does not guarantee usability.

WCAG does not include guidance and requirements for things like expected keyboard combinations and interactions, for example. These types of issues may create barriers that could make your content inaccessible or very difficult to use. An interface that is keyboard-operable may meet WCAG requirements, but what if it is operable using unexpected key combinations that the user is unfamiliar with or that simply do not exist in the user’s native language (and keyboard)? That makes it unusable.

An interface that displays an accessible focus indicator when the user navigates using a keyboard meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements, but if that focus indicator is not persistent, it may disappear even before the user gets a chance to see it if they have poor vision, attention deficit, or if they get distracted by their kids or colleagues long enough to miss it.

If you’re using poor heading hierarchy, non-descriptive link text (in the context of a sentence), a convoluted layout, or complex tables that are difficult to use by screen reader users, you may still be conformant, but your content will be difficult if not impossible to use.

And there are many more examples of issues that could pass WCAG requirements but still cause serious usability issues.

So when you’re building for accessibility the real question isn’t “does it conform to WCAG?” but rather “is it usable by people?”.

WCAG “does not guarantee (or even remotely assure) something is accessible”, says accessibility consultant Adrian Roselli, “including users is the only way to get confidence a thing works.”

## Usability testing is needed to ensure content is accessible and usable

**You can only confidently prove that something is accessible by observing people succeed in using it.**

Usability testing can also help you identify accessibility barriers that are not covered in WCAG. By doing so, you get the competitive advantage of offering a service that is more inclusive.

In their talk _[“Evolving Accessibility, Thinking beyond compliance to inclusion”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_5UCulGkEg)_, Alistair Duggin and Amani Ali share an example from the [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk/) website which clearly demonstrates the difference between providing a service that is just technically compliant, and providing a service that is truly accessible and inclusive.

In a contact form which asks the users for their email and phone number, [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk/) offers their users options to choose how they would like to be contacted: text only (no voice call), or voice only (no text), in addition to the ability to provide another custom option.

These options make their service more accessible to people who are:

- non-verbal,
- deaf or hard of hearing,
- who may have anxiety issues, or
- who have a stuttering problem and prefer to avoid voice calls, or
- those on the autism spectrum who would prefer to text rather than call,
- not to mention people who are simply too busy to take on voice calls.

The form on the left is an example that would pass WCAG requirements and be considered “accessible”. This, while technically conformant, is not not inclusive.

On the right is the same form taking into consideration possible barriers caused by user disabilities, and offering more options for the user to accommodate their needs. This form is inclusive and makes the service provided by GOV.UK more accessible.

While a basic form like the form on the left of the image is technically conformant, their calling service would not really be accessible to someone who has a hearing disability, for example.

These are the kind of accessibility barriers and insights that usability testing can uncover. By putting the user first and including them in your usability tests early on, you can identify possible barriers early in the design phase and come up with better solutions that make your product or service truly accessible and inclusive of as many people as possible.

## WCAG does not mitigate against AT and browser bugs

WCAG also **does not mitigate against assistive technology and browser bugs** which can also cause unexpected barriers. You may be relying on a certain set of ARIA attributes to create a custom interactive component, but if those attributes lack sufficient support, then many of your users will be left out, unable to use your website or app.

## WCAG conformance is the bare minimum

So instead of thinking of WCAG as an end goal, you should **think of the requirements as a baseline for avoiding accessibility issues.**

> **View WCAG not as a end goal, but as a floor. WCAG compliance is one milestone along your organization’s accessibility journey. WCAG compliance is not the end of the journey, because accessibility is a program not a project.** -— **Sheri Byrne-Haber, CPACC,** [“How to avoid Twitter’s latest accessibility mistakes”](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-avoid-twitters-latest-accessibility-mistakes-e0910f9f0ae7)

In other words, **WCAG is just the bare minimum.** You want to meet the minimum requirements to be legally compliant, and go a step further to make your products inclusive.

## Accessibility checklists are a tool not an end goal

It is easy to think of WCAG — and, by extension, accessibility in general — as a checklist that you tick items off and, when you’re “finished”, you pat yourself on the back and and call it a day. But WCAG is only a tool, not an end goal.

Checklists are often used for testing accessibility, but their true value lies in planning for accessibility, says Michael Fairchild, lead accessibility coach and maintainer of [a11ysupport.io](http://a11ysupport.io/).

If you’re a designer, let WCAG requirements inform and guide your design decisions. If you’re a developer who works with designers, use WCAG as guidance (and maybe even leverage!) when you’re discussing inclusivity with the designers and developers on your team:

“Does the design spec include accessible focus styles?”, “Do all interactive controls have clear and visible labels?”, “Are these animations critical to understanding the UI? Does the user have the ability to pause or stop them? What happens when the user has expressed a preference to disable animations?”, “Are we conveying information using color alone? How can we improve on the UI so it makes sense in custom display modes?”

Use accessibility compliance as a framework and WCAG as a tool to design inclusive experiences; but **let compliance be the floor**.

> Meet the minimum standards. Do your WCAG checks. But don’t pat yourself on the back for being compliant. Accessibility is about making things work for people. It’s not passing an assessment or ticking a box to say you meet a standard. It’s about people and their needs just like any other part of user centred design. Do legal compliance as the absolute minimum, but always go further! — Craig Abbott, Head of Accessibility at DWP Digital

## Outro

We will focus on accessibility techniques in this course that will help you achieve legal compliance, but we will also see many examples of where compliance is not enough, and how thinking about the various ways that your users use the content you create can help you create more inclusive and usable websites and applications.

In addition to the WCAG themselves, several supporting documents and resources exist to help make sense of these guidelines. All these resources and documents can be a little overwhelming to make sense of at first. In the next chapter, we will learn more about these resources and how to navigate your way from one document to another.
