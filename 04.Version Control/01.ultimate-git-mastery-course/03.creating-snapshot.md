# Create Snapshot

## create new folder in terminal

```terminal
mkdir project
```

## change current directory

```terminal
cd project
```

## initialize git repository

```zsh
git init
```

## see all files in current directory

```terminal
ls -a
```

## to remove a folder with its files recursively

```terminal
rm -r folder-name
```

## to create new file with content "test text added to file"

```terminal
echo "test text added to file" > test-file.txt
```

## to see files' status

show untracked files and file changes and staged files, you can see files are not committed yet

```zsh
git status
```

## to add files to stage

```zsh
git add new-file.txt
git add new-file.txt test-file.txt
git add *.text
git add .
```

## to append a text to a file

```terminal
echo "second text" >> test-file.txt
```

## to commit changes

```zsh
git commit -m "commit message"
# to open default git editor for commit message
git commit
```

**Note**: _have a standard with your team to use past tense or present tense_

## to combine add all changes and commit

```zsh
git commit -am "commit message"
```

## to see files in staging area

```zsh
git ls-files
```

## to remove a file from directory and staging area

```zsh
git rm file-name
```

## to change file name

```terminal
mv old-name.txt new-name.py
```

**Note**: _renaming files are two stage operation, first add old file as deleted and new file as created, second add renamed file_

### Better approach to rename file using git

```zsh
git mv old-name.txt new-name.py
```
