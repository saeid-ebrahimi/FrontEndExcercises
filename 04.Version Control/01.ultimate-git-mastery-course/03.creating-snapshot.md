# Create Snapshot

## create new folder in terminal

```terminal
mkdir project
```

## change current directory

```terminal
cd project
```

## initialize git repository

```zsh
git init
```

## see all files in current directory

```terminal
ls -a
```

## to remove a folder with its files recursively

```terminal
rm -r folder-name
```

## to create new file with content "test text added to file"

```terminal
echo "test text added to file" > test-file.txt
```

## to see files' status

show untracked files and file changes and staged files, you can see files are not committed yet

```zsh
git status
```

## to add files to stage

```zsh
git add new-file.txt
git add new-file.txt test-file.txt
git add *.text
git add .
```

## to append a text to a file

```terminal
echo "second text" >> test-file.txt
```

## to commit changes

```zsh
git commit -m "commit message"
# to open default git editor for commit message
git commit
```

**Note**: _have a standard with your team to use past tense or present tense_

## to combine add changed files and commit

```zsh
git commit -am "commit message"
```

## to see files in staging area

```zsh
git ls-files
```

## to remove a file from directory and staging area

```zsh
git rm file-name
```

## to change file name

```terminal
mv old-name.txt new-name.py
```

**Note:** _renaming files are two stage operation, first add old file as deleted and new file as created, second add renamed file_

### Better approach to rename file using git

```zsh
git mv old-name.txt new-name.py
```

## add files and folders to .gitignore file

we use .gitignore file to ignore files and folders from tracking or pushing to remote repository

.gitignore file contains file names and folders , we want to ignore

```zsh
echo file-name.txt > .gitignore
echo directory-name > .gitignore
```

**Example:**

```terminal
mkdir logs
echo "first development log" >> logs/dev.log
echo logs/ > .gitignore
```

## To remove a file just from staging area

```zsh
git rm --cached file-name.txt
git rm --cached -r folder-name
```

## files status

```zsh
git status
git status -s
```

**Example:**

```terminal
echo "alert('hello')" >> main.js
echo "line 1" >> test.txt
```

```zsh
git status -s
```

```terminal
echo "alert('end of file')" >> main.js
```

```zsh
git status -s
git add main.js
git status -s
git add test.txt
git status
```

## see the differences in files

- to see file changes in untracked state and staged state

```zsh
git diff
```

- to see only staged changes in files

```zsh
git diff --staged
```

### common diff Tools

- KDiff3
- P4Merge
- WinMerge (windows only)
- VSCode

### to config VSCode as diff tool

```zsh
git config --global diff.tool vscode
```

### to config command to see diff in VSCode

```zsh
git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"
```

### to see differences in vscode

```zsh
git difftool
# or
git difftool --staged
```

## To see commits history form latest to earliest

```zsh
git log
git log --oneline
## reverse the commits sort
git log --reverse
```
