# Branching in Git

## Managing Branches

### to create a branch

```zsh
git branch branch-name
# example
git branch fix-bugs/login
git branch fix-login-bugs
```

### to switch branch

```zsh
git checkout branch-name
git switch branch-name
```

### to create a branch and switch to it

```zsh
git checkout -b branch-name
git switch -C branch-name
```

### to delete a branch

```zsh
git branch -d branch-name
# delete branch by force
git branch -D branch-name
```

### to rename a branch

```zsh
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

## Comparing branches

### to see difference commits between branched

```zsh
git log master..branch-name
# example
git log master..feature
```

### to see content differences between branches

```zsh
git diff master..branch-name
# example
git diff master..feature

# to see difference between current branch and other branch
git diff branch-name
git diff --name-status branch-name
git diff --name-only branch-name
```

## stashing changes

we stash changes to switch between branches and save current branch changes without any commit

```zsh
git stash push -m “New tax rules” # Creates a new stash
git stash push -am “New tax rules”
git stash list # Lists all the stashes
git stash show stash@{1} # Shows the given stash
git stash show 1 # shortcut for stash@{1}
git stash apply 1 # Applies the given stash to the working dir
git stash drop 1 # Deletes the given stash
git stash clear # Deletes all the stashes
```

## Merging branches

_using no fast forward merge help us to make revert a commit easier and we don't need to revert multiple commits_

### fast forward merge

```zsh
git log --oneline --all --graph
git merge bugfix
```

### no fast forward merge

```zsh
git merge --no-ff bugfix
```

### to disable fast forward

```zsh
git config ff no
git config --global ff no
```
