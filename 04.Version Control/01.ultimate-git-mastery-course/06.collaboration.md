git fetch origin # Fetches all objects from origin
git fetch # Shortcut for “git fetch origin”

## Push changes to remote repository

before our push, graph is as below

![before push](before-push.jpg)

after out push graph is as below

![after pushing to remote](after-push.jpg)

```zsh
git push origin master
# Shortcut for “git push origin master”
git push
```

**Note**:most of times our team add some commit to the remote repository, so we need to pull changes first then push it to remote

```zsh
git pull origin master
git push origin master
```

**Caution**: if you encounter an conflict while pushing to the remote, don't use -f option for push command, because it remove your partner changes on remote

```zsh
git push -f # dangerous push command
```
