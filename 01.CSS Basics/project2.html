        In unit 2.3, we defined a CSS selector as the portion of the CSS rule that tells the browser on which HTML
        element to apply the defined style. When your HTML is simple, the selectors can be simple as well. The most
        basic selectors simply mirror the HTML tag. For example "p" attaches to all &lt;p&gt; tags, "img" will attach to
        all &lt;img&gt; tags and so on. As you can imagine, there will often be times when you don't want every single
        HTML element of a particular type to have identical style. In Module 3, we'll discuss a variety of ways to use
        selectors to attach to specific HTML elements.
        In unit 2.2, we briefly mentioned the fact that properties apply to the entire hierarchy of HTML elements to
        which they are attached. This means that you will have to be very careful which selectors you choose to use in
        combination with your chosen style. When choosing your selector you might want to keep the following aspects of
        an HTML element in mind
    </p>
    <h2>Sub Title 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How many of these HTML elements are on my page?</li>
        <li>Do I want this style to apply to every one of these elements?</li>
        <li>What are this HTML element's children</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sub Title 2</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>and do I want this style to apply to them as well?</li>
        <li>Is this element a block element or an inline element</li>
        <li>and does this style make sense in that context?</li>
    </ol>
