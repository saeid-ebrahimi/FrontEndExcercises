## Encapsulating Styles

### what is encapsulated concept?

Restricting the access to some parts of the code and only exposing them through a specific channel

### why encapsulated styles?

For composing styles, we need to make sure that each styled component we build does not lay out styles that result in conflicts with outer components

### Principle #1: Components should not lay themselves out

The component should not set CSS properties like its position, size and margin. These should be decided by the parent component.

### Principle #2: Components only style themselves and only layout their immediate children
